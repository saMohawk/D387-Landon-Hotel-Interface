## D387 â€“ ADVANCED JAVA

Working with Spring Boot with a Java back-end and Angular front end, this is my final project submission for D387, Advanced Java Concepts. 

This project involves applying multi-threaded OOP concepts in a Java framework to develop and deploy an interface for the fictional Landon Hotel. Various messages were displayed, dependent on location and time zone. Functionality with a working database was programmed to display rooms availabile for given dates. 

Finally the app was prepared for deployment with for use in cloud services by building a Docker image and appropiately containerizing the program files.
